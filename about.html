Every single incident of ragging a First Information Report (FIR)
                    must be filed without exception by the institutional authorities with the local police authorities. In some cases, a policeman may issue a citation or refer the prosecuting officer and then it is decided that the case will be prosecuted
                    in the court of out-of-the-court. The cases that are to be handled formally do not necessarily require any filing of the writ or any judicial hearing. The cases that are handled informally, in most cases, they are often dismissed without
                    any litigation. It helps figure out how rape cases should be investigated and prosecuted. If most victims know the identity of their perpetrator, than the investigative issue is not collecting evidence to identify the perpetrator,
                    it will most likely be to require evidence refuting claims by the alleged perpetrator that the sexual activity was consensual. Known perpetrators are unlikely to claim they were mistakenly identified as a defense because forensic examinations
                    con conclusively link the perpetrator to the assault(4). Understandable though such reactions may be, the result is that most crimes of domestic violence go unreported. The last thing that makes these kinds of cases hard to prosecute
                    is that even when victims of domestic violence report attacks to the police, victims often refuse to testify against their attackers at trial. As defendants have a constitutional right to confront and cross-examine their accusers,
                    prosecutors usually cannot offer domestic violence victims’ statements to the police into evidence in lieu of the victims’ actual testimony in court. According to the Michigan Family Impact seminars, 90 percent of teen prostitutes
                    have been sexually abused when they were younger. (Rape Victim Advocates, 2008). This clearly shows how much sexual abuse or rape can destroy an innocent’s life. Even without actually taking the life of the child, it deprives the child
                    of what would have been a better future. Charges may be filed by mail or in person at their nearest EEOC office. Once an employee or applicant files a charge, the EEOC then serves notice on the employer, usually by mail, that a charge
                    has been filed against them. This notice normally includes a copy of the actual charge filed by the employee or applicant. Successful prosecutions of rape cases often require victims to produce evidence of physical injuries to prove
                    they did not consent. The fact that the vast majority of rape victims do not sustain major physical injuries also has clear implications for investigation and prosecution. The first implication is that most victims will not show physical
                    injuries, causing many people to conclude the victim consented(3). In it, the committee noted that police training (at that time) generally instructed against the arrest of a batterer unless he was actually found hitting the victim
                    or unless the victim had suffered injuries that were “severe enough to require a certain number of stitches. During July of 1982, the House of Commons suggested that Parliament push all police to lay charges for acts of wife beating
                    considering they lay charges for other forms of assault (Department of Justice, 2009). It was also suggested in 1983 by the Federal Provincial Task Force on Justice for Victims of Crime that there be written guidelines developed to
                    direct officers to treat wife assault as a crime and that the act of prosecution be made without the woman’s consent (Department of Justice, 2009). Section 6 (m) involves the failure to reimburse expenses incurred by the worker in
                    connection with his documentation and processing for purposes of deployment, in cases in which the deployment does not actually take place without the worker’s fault. A thorough scrutiny of the prosecution’s evidence reveals that it
                    failed to prove appellant’s liability under Section 6 (l) of R.A. No. 8042. [Original source: https://essaytoolbox.com/essay-maker].</h1>
